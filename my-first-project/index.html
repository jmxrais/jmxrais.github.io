        <h3>brat and it's the same but there's three more songs so it's not</h3>
        <p><b>charli xcx</b></p>
        <p>this is my album of the year. not the first, not the remix album. this one.</p>
        <p>this is an iconic pop album. brat has set the ethos of the 2020s: it is a great resume of the post-pandemic
          party scene and equally the mentally disthrot gen z is under. it is the end of the world and we don't know
          whether we party or plan on having children, while we wonder whether we make any difference to the people
          around us. also, drugs.</p>

      <h3>maria esmeralda</h3>
      <p><b>thalin feat. cravinhos feat. VCR slim</b></p>
      <p>this is a great brazilian album. it is a hard album to classify because it merges rap, hip-hop, MPB and other
        genres, creating something that could be extremely chaotic - but isn't. the use of sampling is precise, yet
        unavoidable. it is an album with a story, but also one that opens up to many other narratives and sounds.</p>
      <p>i like it very much.</p>

      <p><b>magdalena bay</b></p>
      <p>this is a great pop album. i'd qualify it as a dream pop album because the vocals are rather otherwordly and the lyrics are somewhat dreamy, yet they remain relatable. the sound production is delicate yet complete, but not overwhelming.</p>
      <p>this is not usually my genre but i like it very much.</p>
